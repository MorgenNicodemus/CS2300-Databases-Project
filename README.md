# Don't Fear The Reaver
## Morgen Nicodemus, Pamela Petterchak, Nicholas Lambert

CS2300 Databases project

Uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySql

How I'm setup
----------------------
I'm currently using Atom with a php-server plug-in. Requires php be installed, php goes in C: drive. MySQL seems to require Python 3.6 64-bit version. Git can also be used with Atom to have a nice lil gui and such. Just install git, pull the repo, (maybe set origin? don't remember), and open the folder/files in Atom.

### To-do
- Write challenges/put them in the database
- Edit CSS, Make site look Nice
- Make logo
- Finish Scoreboard page
- Work on Puzzle & Account pages
- Admin log-in doesn't currently work? Can we make Admin a T/F value on the player account, and adjust to fit?
- Figure out how admin stuff will work on webpage anyways
- Figure out Team stuff?
