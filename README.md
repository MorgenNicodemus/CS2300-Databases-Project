## Morgen Nicodemus, Pamela Petterchak, Nicholas Lambert

CS2300 Databases project

Uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySql

How I'm setup
----------------------
I'm currently using Atom with a php-server plug-in. Requires php be installed, php goes in C: drive. MySQL seems to require Python 3.6 64-bit version. Git can also be used with Atom to have a nice lil gui and such. Just install git, pull the repo, (maybe set origin? don't remember), and open the folder/files in Atom.

### To-do
- Put challenges in database, make categories to go along with the challenges
- Edit CSS, Make site look Nice
- Make logo
- Finish Scoreboard page
- Finish ranking system
    - In progress, please check work (Pamela)
