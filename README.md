CS2300 Databases project

Uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySql

How I'm setup
----------------------
I'm currently using Atom with a php-server plug-in. Requires php be installed, php goes in C: drive. MySQL seems to require Python 3.6 64-bit version. Git can also be used with Atom to have a nice lil gui and such. Just install git, pull the repo, (maybe set origin? don't remember), and open the folder/files in Atom.
  - Working on getting this set up on my end for testing, then I'll start picking up more work. -Pamela

### To-do
- Put challenges in database, make categories to go along with the challenges
- Edit CSS, Make site look Nice
- Make logo
- Finish Scoreboard page
- Work on Account page
    - In progress, please check work (Pamela)
- Admin log-in doesn't currently work? Can we make Admin a T/F value on the player account, and adjust to fit?
    - I'm in favor of doing Admin as a T/F on the player account - it will just impact our ER diagram -Pamela
- Figure out how admin stuff will work on webpage anyways
    - I assume each admin has a category they are allowed to edit? So we need to set them up to have permission
      to edit their category. -Pamela
- Figure out Team stuff?
    - Idea: if somebody registers for a non-existent team, create a new team. If the team already exists, add
      the new member to the pre-existing team. Would involve editing the registration page. -Pamela
